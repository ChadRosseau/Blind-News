            <p>Our aim as a student-run non-profit NGO is to distribute news to a teenage demographic; informing them about events of global significance, and subsequently increasing the cultural awareness of our community. As students of an international school, it is vital that we keep up-to-date on the daily events around the world, in order to form thoughts and opinions befitting of global citizens. Through Blind News, we provide a student-friendly news platform, giving students access to a wide range of articles across several different topics, to cater for everyone’s interests. The best thing about Blind News is that it is by students, for students. We understand how students think and write friendly, fun articles where students can hear the writer’s behind the words.</p>

            <p>We have created two platforms through which students are able to access the articles written by our Writers Division. The first of which is a website, fully decked out with features such as interactive articles, a filterable archive, descriptions of our organisation and what we do, as well as a fully functioning article-creation page for our writers. Along with this, we have created a compact mobile app for our mobile viewers, with a continuous stream of the latest news ready to view. We have ensured to minimise cpu and battery usage by the app to reduce strain on the viewer’s phones. Together, these platforms form the base of news distribution by Blind News, across a variety of devices.</p>
